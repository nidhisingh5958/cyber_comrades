pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your Groq API key and other configurations

# Run the backend server
python main.py
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Verify Flutter installation
flutter doctor

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the application
flutter run -d macos  # or windows/linux based on your OS
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
DEFAULT_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

The backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

- **`POST /chat/`** - Send messages to the AI cybersecurity assistant
- **`GET /info/{topic}`** - Retrieve information about specific cybersecurity topics
- **`POST /logs/`** - Upload and analyze security log files
- **`GET /`** - Health check endpoint

### API Documentation
When the backend is running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation.

## 💻 Usage Examples
